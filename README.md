**Focus:** Virtual Threads (Project Loom), Declarative HTTP Clients, and Java 25 features.

**Why this project?** Spring Framework 7 fully embraces Virtual Threads, making reactive programming less critical for
high-throughput I/O. This project replaces complex WebFlux chains with simple, blocking-style code that runs efficiently
on virtual threads.
